# ibm-challenge-fall-2021-submission
My submission for [IBM's Quantum Challenge Fall 2021](https://challenges.quantum-computing.ibm.com/fall-2021). All exercises were completed and marked except for `4c`.

In fall of 2021, IBM's Quantum team together with [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) and [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/) has developed a diverse and engaging set of challenges, each of which involves using Qiskit, IBM's open source Python library for quantum computing to solve for the problem. The 4 problems presented in the challenge were:

* Finance - Optimizing your portfolio with quantum computers
* Nature - Band gap calculation of OLED molecules
* Machine Learning - Image classification by QSVM
* Optimization - Battery Revenue Optimization
